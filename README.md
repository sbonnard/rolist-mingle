# Rolist-Mingle
## Don't Roll Single
A web app to mingle with other rolists and play more often.
This is my main project for now. I had the idea of a social media during my dev studies in Creative Tech School at HÃ©rouville Saint Clair.
I want to deal with accessibilty issues on the whole project so it respects the POUR principles : Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust.

I want to go on this project after my school year is over and I hope you will enjoy my work here !
